# Given an array nums of unique integers, return all possible subsets of nums.

# The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the solution in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3]

# Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]


# Given a string s, split s into substrings where every substring is a palindrome. Return all possible lists of palindromic substrings.

# You may return the solution in any order.

# Example 1: Palndrome Parititioning

# Input: s = "aab"

# Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]



# Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a string word, return true if the word is present in the grid, otherwise return false.

# For the word to be present it must be possible to form it with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.

# Input: Word search
# board = [
#   ["A","B","C","D"],
#   ["S","A","A","T"],
#   ["A","C","A","E"]
# ],
# word = "CAT"

# Output: true

# Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a list of strings words, return all words that are present in the grid.

# For a word to be present it must be possible to form the word with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.
